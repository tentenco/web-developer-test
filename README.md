# Web Developer Test

## Objective
Create a landing page that matches the design. Add animation base on your own creativity. There will be score and points to evaluate your ability.

Here's some of the stuff that I would like to see on how you implement the page:
- Semantic Markup
- SEO & social media ready
- Animation using JS or CSS3
- Write a gulp workflow from scratch that will execute:
    - compile SASS
    - minify the project
    - command to zip files
    - local test reload (browsersync)

⭐️ **Bonus**
- Write your JS with ES6 and you can also use VueJs, React or other alternatives.
- Write your markup with HTML templates but not limited to Twig, Pug, Nunjucks, or other alternatives
- Host the HTML in Netlify

### Design
We're going to send an invitation for Zeplin mockup, please pay attention to the details. You can add whatever animation you want but simple is better.

## Procedure
You will have 3 days turn over time to work on this. 

2. Create a git repo in Github
3. Update the files to your git repo
4. Send a notification to me thru email: **clark.young@tenten.co** with the repository's link,

⭐️ Some notes to consider as bonus:
- Best practice of commit messages

- Code cleanliness
